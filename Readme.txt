Z# City game project inspired by codingWithRadu

Overview:

The contains a huge map which has some buildings and some other decoration stuff as well. The Map also has a huge network of roads that are connected with each other. some components of the game includes a Player Car, npc cars and traffic lights. The npc cars would just be simple AI neural networks that are trained to stop at the obsticals and go if there is not obstical. We would have a variety of cars which would also show traffic simulation as well where each car would have its own neural network. The player has the ability to control the car,  or to pass car to AI and using Pathfinding algorithm to go to any location that is plotted by the User.

Functionality:

The system is simple, we would have a big network of cars and roads each would be perfectly aligned with each other and easily work without crashing into one another. the player has the ability to explore the map as well as the ability to pass its car to AI and watch it as the user selects the location on the map and AI uses Pathfinding Algorithm to go to its destination. Then the user just sees it going toward its destinations

Key Features:

The key features include:
1. AI Cars for Traffic simulation
2. Tangled roads for variety of Destinations
3. 3D Randered Trees with different sizes and green shades
4. 3D Randered houses
5. All 3D objects Randered by Frustum Culling
